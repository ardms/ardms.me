# Working with a Team

## First you need to find a team

Long post I'm afraid sorry. The purpose of this group has been to
investigate on the possibility on continuing working together as a team more at
the universe of Freelance. I'm still very interested in progressing with this
idea. So this message is my attempt to start a conversation about who is
interested and who is not. If you are interested then let me know. I don't want
this group to become one of those inactive groups that stand in my WhatsApp and
so if there is not enough momentum we can just delete the group

## Keep the team motivated

1. Set business goals. Have clear goals with strong ethics that resonate with the team
1. Embrace diversity. In all aspects.
2. Well defined roles for the team members. Clear __targets__
1. Lead by example
1. Allow your team to take risks and experiment. Never blame. Always use mistakes to learn a lesson
1. Publicly recognise excellent work
1. Both team building activities and social events are needed
