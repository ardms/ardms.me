# Time passes

Today I realised that it has been 4 years since I have started managing people
and was _allowed_ to have my own small team. The jurney was not smooth, I was a
senior engineed and/or analyst for more that 5 years in diferent companies. In
my curent role I was brought in to do performance analysis on operational Solar
and Wind projects and I did mention from the begining that this is not a job
for one person. Took me only a few months to persuade them.
