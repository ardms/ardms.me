# Intro 

Have been thinking about this for a while. I would like to use a humidity and temperature sencor connected to a raspberry pi to save measurements to a database that I then connect and display the results in the local network. 


# Needed components

1. __DHT22__. Humidity sensor
1. __Raspberry Pi__.
