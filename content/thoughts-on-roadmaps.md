# Summary

This is a collection of thoughts on the importance of having a Roadmap and how to properly put one together.

I have recently started to appreciate the benefits of having a roadmap in my professional life.

# What a Roadmap is not!

## Product discovery

This is what should happen first

## Product Design

This is what should happen after the roadmap? 

## Prioritise feature requests

[This post](https://www.svpg.com/product-roadmaps/?ref=stephen.fm) by SVPG
resonates with me. While in my profession I don't deal a lot with _feature
requests_ I do deal with clients/customers that requests services. Building a
roadmap should not be just a task of prioritising those requests. Services
requested by Customers should be considered during the Product discovery phase. 

## A monologue

Roadmap is meant to be a tool to communicate time, money and effort. So it is
meant to be discussed and agreed with all the stakeholders.

# What a Roadmap is

There are many different roadmaps. _Portfolio roadmap_ / _product roadmap_. I would put them in a hierarchical order. Hi level roadmaps serve the purpose of communicating with higher management, there is also a roadmap that can communicate with external customers. Those should have a higher level of abstraction. Generally when communicating with higher management and customers give yourself as much maneuvering room as possible in terms of how that vision will be realized.

Lower level roadmaps should be __simple__ but not simplistic
