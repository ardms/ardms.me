    <p>There was this question that popped up in Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32418592">Link</a>
and I almost added a comment but then I thought as always that would be better
to organise my thoughts first here. </p>
<h1>What</h1>
<p>The question was simple "Someones daughter is asking: How do you save the planet"</p>
<h1>To the point</h1>
<p>The first idea would be that the Planet is not the one needing saving. What I 
mean by that is that planet will most probably continue spinning no mater what. 
At least as for as "Climate change" is concerned and in the context of recent 
political and economical changes. Even if we "nuke" the Planet then we will 
probably eliminate every living organism apart from maybe cockroaches but the planet
itself will continue spinning and rotating around the sun. </p>
<p>The most crucial question would be how we prevent humans from altering the world
they leave in to such a degree that it becomes unlivable. Or most probably how to
prevent humans from making life on Earth increasingly more difficult.</p>
<p>One might argue that one person can't do much to collectively improve the life of many
but as the famous quote goes <strong>Our greatest ability as humans is not to change 
the world; but to change ourselves.</strong> </p>
<p>There are dedicated articles on what someone can do like 
<a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/thingsyoucando">WWF's dedicated page</a>, but I would start 
from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/">IPCC Assessment Report</a> the report
is created by United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If we only look 
at the graph <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/figures/summary-for-policymakers/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FigureSPM7.png">here</a> we can draw useful conclusions about what will have the mist impact in the world. 
While this is mostly targeted to industries and policy makers I would argue that
the conclusions can be applied equally to smaller scale and personal level. </p>
