<p>This is a collection of thoughts on the importance of having a Roadmap and how to properly put one together.</p>
<p>I have recently started to appreciate the benefits of having a roadmap in my professional life.</p>
<h1>What a Roadmap is not!</h1>
<h2>Product discovery</h2>
<p>This is what should happen first</p>
<h2>Product Design</h2>
<p>This is what should happen after the roadmap? </p>
<h2>Prioritise feature requests</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.svpg.com/product-roadmaps/?ref=stephen.fm">This post</a> by SVPG
resonates with me. While in my profession I don't deal a lot with <em>feature
requests</em> I do deal with clients/customers that requests services. Building a
roadmap should not be just a task of prioritising those requests. Services
requested by Customers should be considered during the Product discovery phase. </p>
<h2>A monologue</h2>
<p>Roadmap is meant to be a tool to communicate time, money and effort. So it is
meant to be discussed and agreed with all the stakeholders.</p>
<h1>What a Roadmap is</h1>
<p>There are many different roadmaps. <em>Portfolio roadmap</em> / <em>product roadmap</em>. I would put them in a hierarchical order. Hi level roadmaps serve the purpose of communicating with higher management, there is also a roadmap that can communicate with external customers. Those should have a higher level of abstraction. Generally when communicating with higher management and customers give yourself as much maneuvering room as possible in terms of how that vision will be realized.</p>
<p>Lower level roadmaps should be <strong>simple</strong> but not simplistic</p>

<p>Electricity generators enter into contracts to sell electricity to retailers
(who expect to use that electricity for their residential and commercial
customers). These can be traded several years ahead, right through to the hour
in question. In fact, it is not just generators selling to retailers: other

<p>The service is about calculating statistics related to faults, repairs and site
access. Generally this is a foundation service that collects statistics from
three different places:
1. Wind turbine statuses
2. Site access statistics
3. Tasks</p>
