    <h1>Summary</h1>
<p>This is a collection of thoughts on the importance of having a Roadmap and how to properly put one together.</p>
<p>I have recently started to appreciate the benefits of having a roadmap in my professional life.</p>
<h1>What a Roadmap is not!</h1>
<h2>Product discovery</h2>
<p>This is what should happen first</p>
<h2>Product Design</h2>
<p>This is what should happen after the roadmap? </p>
<h2>Prioritise feature requests</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.svpg.com/product-roadmaps/?ref=stephen.fm">This post</a> by SVPG
resonates with me. While in my profession I don't deal a lot with <em>feature
requests</em> I do deal with clients/customers that requests services. Building a
roadmap should not be just a task of prioritising those requests. Services
requested by Customers should be considered during the Product discovery phase. </p>
<h2>A monologue</h2>
<p>Roadmap is meant to be a tool to communicate time, money and effort. So it is
meant to be discussed and agreed with all the stakeholders.</p>
<h1>What a Roadmap is</h1>
<p>There are many different roadmaps. <em>Portfolio roadmap</em> / <em>product roadmap</em>. I would put them in a hierarchical order. Hi level roadmaps serve the purpose of communicating with higher management, there is also a roadmap that can communicate with external customers. Those should have a higher level of abstraction. Generally when communicating with higher management and customers give yourself as much maneuvering room as possible in terms of how that vision will be realized.</p>
<p>Lower level roadmaps should be <strong>simple</strong> but not simplistic</p>
